### Hi there, I'm Robert, an Open Source and computer enthusiast.

* Currently, I'm on the way to becoming a self-taught programmer. I have a [blog](https://skinzor.github.io) where I'll be writing about my journey.
* My current pinned repositories are about the work I've did for the Android device which I've owned previously. This work has been released on [XDA-Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/) and my XDA profile is [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4471434).
